        <p class="header__description">I am an amatour artist with big love to painting. I have never been taught how to do that and I am learning by trial and error.
            I would like to convince you that everyone can start painting and just simply enjoy it. I believe imperfections makes artworks unique and
            interesting. It is about creating your own view and putting your current feelings into it.
